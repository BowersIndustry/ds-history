            The Nintendo DS (DS for short) was released on November 21, 2004. The DS family is Nintendo’s best-selling handheld console! It just happens to also be Nintendo’s best-selling console! The Nintendo DS is the second-best selling video game console ever. It sold about 154.02 million units!
        </p>
        <p>
            The name “DS” stands for “Dual Screen”. The DS has two screens, and the bottom is a touch screen! The DS has a couple wireless functions: connecting to other DS consoles as well as connecting to the internet! The DS and DS Lite systems can both play GB Advance (GBA) games! However when Nintendo released the DSi that functionality was removed. The DS has a microphone! Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story, one of the best DS games in my opinion, uses the microphone! There we also a couple DS games that took advantage of the GBA slot. Some games allowed you to use the Rumble Pak to vibrate your console when something happened in game.

            With the great success of the DS, you expect some great games, right? Well, good news! The DS has an amazing library of games. According to Wikipedia, some of the best-selling DS games are,<br>1. New Super Mario Bros.</br><br>2. Nintendogs</br><br>3. Mario Kart DS</br><br>4.	Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!</br><br>5. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally I only have experience with New Super Mario Bros. but these games seem like really nice, solid games!

    <h2>The Homebrew Era:</h2>

        <p>
            To get your game sold in stores, you would have to get your game licensed by Nintendo. But many people didn’t want to or didn’t know how to do that. That’s when in 2007, the R4 Revolution was released! This allowed you to run homebrew DS games on real hardware!
        </p>
        <p>
            What is homebrew? Homebrew is basically tools and/or games built by people for specific hardware. DS homebrew would be tools or games built for the DS. Some DS homebrew games/tools include,

            How do you make your own homebrew game/tools? Currently there are a few tools that allow you to do that: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><a href="https://dsgamemaker.online/">•	DS Game Maker (DSGM)</a> was created by James Garner and was released in 2008. DSGM is good for beginners who don’t have any experience in programming, although some background in programming is beneficial.</br><br>
            <a href="https://devkitpro.org/">•	devkitPro</a> allows you to create games for multiple different systems. One being the DS. Knowing C or C++ is required to use this.</br><br>
            <a href="https://bowersindustry.github.io/Pages/DSC_Docs/documentation_main.html">•	DS Creator (DSC)</a> is the newest of these tools. It is still in early development. It is being developed by Kenyon Bowers (me).</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter if you are just wanting to make a game, or if you want to make a really helpful application, the DS is an awesome piece of hardware! I highly recommend you try out some of these tools!
